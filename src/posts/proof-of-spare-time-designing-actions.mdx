In the last post I introduced a consistency rule as a desirable property for distributed reducers.

> Given a tree of actions $T$ and a partial order "$\leq_T$" implied by that tree, any reduction order $R$ in which $a \leq_T b \implies a <_R b$ will result in the same state.

This guarantees that everyone will end up in the same state after all actions are applied. When we structure our action history as a tree, each action $A$ either contains some reference to a parent $P$, or is assumed to have the root of the tree (the default state) as a parent. The consistency rule requires that actions can be arbitrarily reordered when being fed to the reducer, as long as we always run $P$ before we run $A$.

What we need to design actions that satisfy this rule is to determine when reordering actions would definitely be ok. The simplest example of this is the reducer that simply returns the whole tree after applying an action. When we go to apply an action $A$, as long as it's parent is already in the tree there will be an obvious place to add $A$ to the tree.

### Some Free Lunch

The tree of actions as a state satisfies our consistency rule for free. That may not sound useful, but in many cases what you want as a state is close to the tree of actions itself. 

Reddit is a great example of this. Each post does not depend in any way on any other post. The parent of any post is the root. Each comment either has a post or another comment as a parent. If our only action is `addComment` reddit satisfies our consistency rule for free. Our lean coffee table has a similar structure, which is discussion topics. Because discussion topics can't conflict in any way, `addTopic` satisfies our rule for free.

To figure out how we would handle voting, it helps to think through how we might do this on paper. We want to get as many people as possible to support our petition. We don't have to have only one copy of the petition that we hand around whenever someone wants to sign it; we can have many copies of the petition, and signing a copy is enough because later, when we add up all the signatures, if some very odd person was going around signing the petition over and over again we could just deduplicate all of their signatures.

When we write this structure out as a type, it becomes easier to see how this translate to code.

```typescript
type Petition = {
  votes: {
    [voterId: string]: Signature<Vote>
  }
  /* Some other properties */
}


type Person = {
  id: PublicKey
  validate<T>(s: Signature<T>, id: PublicKey) => boolean
}

type Self = Person & {
  sign: <T>(t: T) => Signature<T>
}

type PublicKey = string & {_type: 'publicKey'}

type Signature<T> = ArrayBuffer & {_type: 'signature' _signed: T}>
```

_This example uses a typescript trick called [branding](https://medium.com/better-programming/nominal-typescript-eee36e9432d2). This allows us to get some of the benefits of nominal types in typescript. If it's not something you've seen before, don't worry about it too much, and just ignore everything in the `PublicKey` and `Signature` types that comes after an intersection (&)._

When we get a new `vote` action, we add a key with that voter id to the `votes` object. Then when we want to count up how many votes we received we count how many keys the vote object has. Actions can't conflict, they can just be duplicated, and we can dedup actions as we apply them to the tree.

Changing our votes can be similarly free. We can have an `unvote` action that must have as a parent a `vote` action. This guarantees that when that `unvote` action is processed, there is already a vote in the tree to remove.

This doesn't quite get us to reddit style voting, or to lean coffee voting. There are other things we might want to be able to do.

- Vote up and also down
- Have $n$ votes to divide between topics as we see fit

These things don't come for free. To get things like this we need to build some conflict resolution into our reducer.

### Conflict Resolution

If we want to be able to vote against something as well as for it, we need some way to handle the situation where someone first cast a vote down, then a vote up. The goal here is to make some rule that would be part of our reducer function that handles such conflicts, and the trick is going to be embedded in the `Vote` type.

In our types above, we reference the `Vote` type but we don't define what it is. We can have that type carry information that we use to do conflict resolution. For example, if our user is likely to be only using one device at a time, we might use a timestamp to determine which vote action we should honor.

```typescript
type Vote = {
  when: Date;
  direction: "up" | "down";
};
```

Timestamps have drawbacks, but in many cases can be good enough as long as in the worst case, accepting the wrong action would not be catastrophic. In this case, accepting the wrong action might mean the user voted down instead of up. They'll live.

### Derived or Nonlocal State

Allowing the user to arbitrarily distribute $n$ votes is harder. In the above example we basically just give a way to _entirely overwrite_ an action. When distributing a set number of votes, we have an invariant that goes between many actions. To maintain that invariant we need to restrict the actions in some way, and that means making some decisions about the user experience.

We could design actions such that the timestamp is still the only thing that matters.

```typescript
type Vote = Date;
```

There are a few ways to handle actions like this.

- When the vote limit is hit, the reducer finds and removes the oldest vote when applying the most recent one.
- When the vote limit is hit, new vote actions are remembered but ignored until an unvote action removes an older vote.

In the second case, we'd need to extend the state with some sort of holding area for votes that could not be applied when they were received. That will allow us to process those votes correctly when an unvote action eventually makes them valid.

Neither of these would provide great user experiences on their own. The first would remove votes from topics in a way that might not make sense to the user. The second could also be very confusing, with actions from a long time ago getting applied suddenly when the user removes an existing vote. To help mitigate this it might be worth maintaining some local, non distributed state to set up guardrails against the user doing things that would feel unintuitive.

### General Principles

We've walked through how to handle the particular actions we'll need for the lean coffee table, but it's worth reflecting on these and trying to extract some general principles.

When we can construct actions that add something immutable to the state, like discussion topics or reddit comments or simple approval voting, they will satisfy our consistency rule for free.

When we need actions that can't be structured that way, we need build conflict resolution into our reducer. This might involve extending the state with a space to remember actions which have no visible effect right away, because an action might appear later that makes them relevant again.

Nonlocal state can often appear confusing or unintuitive to users. It is worth avoiding if possible. If it is absolutely necessary, setting up guardrails to keep users away from the weirdest corners of our conflict resolution might help the user experience.

### Eventual Consistency Means Occasional Dragons

Our consistency rule guarantees that as long as we have a conflict resolution strategy, once every action is applied we will have a consistent state. However, it doesn't say anything about what states users might see before every action is applied. Imagine if we have topics A, B, and C, and the following sequence of actions;

- Sam votes for A
- Sam votes for C
- Sam unvotes for A
- Sam votes for B

At the end of all actions, I will have a vote for B and a vote for C, but before all actions are applied, users could see a variety of states that never actually occurred.

- Sam voted for all three topics
- Sam only voted for B
- Sam voted for A and B but not C

Deciding to build an eventually consistent system means accepting that this behavior is acceptable for our use case.
